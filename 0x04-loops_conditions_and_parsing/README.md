This directory contains Bash scripts focused on **loops (for, while, until), conditional statements (if, elif, else), case statements, file testing, and string manipulation** — all part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum.

### Scripts:

- **1-for_best_school**         → Displays "Best School" 10 times using a `for` loop  
- **2-while_best_school**       → Displays "Best School" 10 times using a `while` loop  
- **3-until_best_school**       → Displays "Best School" 10 times using an `until` loop  
- **4-if_9_say_hi**             → Displays "Best School" 10 times using `while`, but prints "Hi" on the 9th iteration  
- **5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance** → Loops from 1 to 10:  
  → "bad luck" on 4th  
  → "good luck" on 8th  
  → "Best School" otherwise  
- **6-superstitious_numbers**   → Loops from 1 to 20 and displays:  
  → 4 → "bad luck from China"  
  → 9 → "bad luck from Japan"  
  → 17 → "bad luck from Italy"  
  → otherwise just the number  
- **8-for_ls**                  → Lists current directory contents (no hidden files), showing only the part of each filename **after the first dash**  
- **9-to_file_or_not_to_file**  → Checks the `school` file and prints:  
  → if it exists or not  
  → if it's empty or not  
  → if it's a regular file (only if it exists)
